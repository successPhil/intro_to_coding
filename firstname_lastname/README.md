# Instructions
Write a function that takes your first name and last name as arguments and returns your first and last name as a single string. 

# Example:
`fullName('Michael', 'Jordan') ==> 'Michael Jordan'`

# Note:
The problems from intro to coding were designed as intro javascript challenge problems. To help learn python I will be solving in both. See the main.py or js file respectively.
