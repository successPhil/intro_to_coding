# Instructions:

All of the students in 5th and 6th grade have detention. You can tell a student is in 6th grade if 6 is the highest number in their student id; if the highest number in their student id is less than 6 they are younger and if it's greater than 6 they are older. The same rule applies for 5th grade students.

Write a method that takes in a student's id as a string of unknown length and returns a boolean true if that student has detention or false if they do not.

```js
haveDetention("1gh3btsduv6") ==> true
haveDetention("1gh3btsduv67") ==> false
```
